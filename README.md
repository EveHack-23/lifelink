Life Link is a community driven platform in its infancy to co-ordinate and collaborate medical services and lookups on blood / organ donors .etc . basically lookup and hookup medical stuff including and not excluding essential medicines , medical equipment for specially needed .etc


## Problem Statement
We are in need of :
- a centralized platform for blood donation.
- a robust system to find trained care personnel.
- a way to scrutinize charity cases.
- a platform to co-ordinate volunteering work.
- a platform that incentivize volunteering in a proper way. 

## Existing Solutions
- they lack regular maintenance.
- donor status are not updated.
- social media post maybe misleading.
- fake/scam charity cases.
- proprietary solutions.
- not focused on healthcare sector.

### Life 'Ink' - Blood Donation Module
- civilians can perform a search/lookup of blood donors based on locality and blood type.
- registered institutions and volunteers can request for the amount / type and characteristics of blood needed.
- our algorithm will search for suitable donors based on given parameters and 
	- send the request to selected donors through a delivering mechanism (Eg: WhatsApp Bot).
		- age, locality, previous donations, last donated date are considered for selection
		- our model will predict who all are likely to donate blood and prioritize alerts.
	- donors can either "Accept" or "Decline" the request via codes like Y/N 1/0 .etc
	- accepted Donors will be provided with the Hospital Location.
	- a small buffer of donors are also contacted based on the algorithm to account for withdrawal/incompatibility of accepted users.
	- active volunteers are given priority in these lists to ensure participation.
	- pull data from existing sources and update them.
